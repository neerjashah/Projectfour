          <h1>Before 1973</h1>
          <p>
            Polar bears are an integral part of the Arctic ecosystem and the
            food web for Indigenous Peoples -- who have hunted polar bears
            sustainably for millennia. But, beginning in the 1700s, large-scale
            hunting by European, Russian and North American hunters and trappers
            took place, raising concerns about the future survival of polar
            bears. Unregulated commercial and recreational hunting continued
            until the 1970s.

            Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway and the former USSR
            signed the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar
            Bears and their Habitat, strictly regulating commercial hunting. The
            US Government classified the Polar Bear under its Endangered Species
            Act (ESA).

            Ministers and other leaders from the five polar bear range states
            met in Moscow for the first International Forum on Polar Bear
            Conservation. The leaders made significant commitments to address
            issues of polar bear habitat, research and trade. This event was

          <h1>Today</h1>
          <p>
            Today, polar bears are among the few large carnivores that are still
            found in roughly their original habitat and range--and in some
            places, in roughly their natural numbers. Although most of the
            world's 19 populations have returned to healthy numbers, there are
            differences between them. Some are stable, some seem to be
            increasing, and some are decreasing due to various pressures. Status
            of the polar bear populations Updated 2019 with data from the IUCN
            Polar Bear Specialists Group
